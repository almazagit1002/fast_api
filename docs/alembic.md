# Alembic
For using Alembic with FastAPI to perform data migrations and initial data insertion, you'll follow a the following approach. Alembic primarily handles schema migrations, but you can include data insertion in the migration script's upgrade function to initialize your database with the provided data. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

## Setting up Alembic with FastAPI

### Set Up Alembic Configuration

Create an Alembic configuration file (alembic.ini). This file specifies how Alembic should connect to your database.

```
alembic init
```
In alembic.ini, update the line with your databse configuration
```
sqlalchemy.url= postgresql+psycopg2://{DB_USERNAME}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}/{DB_NAME}
```
### Generate Initial Migration

Use Alembic to generate an initial migration that includes creating tables and inserting initial data.
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema and data"

```
This command generates a new migration script in your alembic/versions directory.

### Edit Migration Script

Open the generated migration script (alembic/versions/*.py) and modify the upgrade() function to insert the initial data.

Adjust the schema and data according to your specific requirements.

### Run Migrations
Apply the migration to your database:
```
alembic upgrade head

```
